Characterize uncertainty when dose or exposure is reported as censored intervals

Supervisor: Dr. Jacqueline Gibson from Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering at North Carolina State University

The uncertainty is characterized as probabilistic distribution.
Distributional parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation.
Estimated parameters are used to simulate data points from truncated distributions.
